I've created a profile UI inspired by the CRED app shown in the reference image, implementing a sleek dark-themed interface with all the key elements. The implementation features a modular component structure with separate files for different sections of the profile page, making the code maintainable and easy to extend.

The UI includes all the requested sections: user profile with avatar, financial metrics including credit score with refresh option, lifetime cashback, bank balance check, rewards and benefits section, and transactions section. Each component is styled with Tailwind CSS to match the sophisticated design of the reference, with proper spacing, typography, and interactive elements.
